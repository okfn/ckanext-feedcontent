# Feed Extension

The Feed extension allows site administrators to include blog entries in the main content of templates using named
references to atom or rss feeds.

**Note: This extension requires ckan 1.7 or higher**

## Activating and Installing

To install the plugin, enter your virtualenv and load the source::

 (pyenv)$ git install -e hg+https://github.com/okfn/ckanext-feedcontent#egg=ckanext-feedcontent

This will also register a plugin entry point, so you now should be
able to add the following to your CKAN .ini file::

 ckan.plugins = feed_content <other-plugins>

**At this point nothing will have happened**! To add feeds to your system see the next section.
